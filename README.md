- 👋 Hi, I’m @isgo5880
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and numerical modeling, specifically in the intersection of the fields of computer science and biology or the atmosphere.
- 🌱 I’m proficient in C++, C, HTML, and CSS. I have briefly worked with JavaScript, Python, Mocha, and Chai. I'm also pretty good at going at something until I get it to work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can email me at isgo5880@colorado.edu.
